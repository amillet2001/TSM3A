    <p2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 25px;"><b>Though confusing at times, I eventually understood the lesson bit by bit despite my mind forgetting most of the time. The importance of <br>
    of each topic serves at its own rights. He's doing his best to teach and adjust no matter how difficult. He is kind yet there are limitations of <br>
    ones kindness. I appreciate his efforts.<br>
    <h5> </h5>
    All the best.</p2></b>
